Functionnality: If the image is out of focus, the phase difference data between images is used to calculate how far the lens needs to be moved to bring it into focus.  
Advantages: 1. donâ€™t need to use every pixel on the camera to figure out the focus. Instead, several pixel strips across the sensor will do. Typically only 5 to 10% of sensor pixels are reserved for autofocusing.  
            2. With PDAF, the phase difference is used to almost immediately calculate how far the lens needs to be moved to achieve focus.  
            

Disadvantage:  Vertical strips mean that cameras can have problems focusing on horizontal lines, so better sensors use cross focus patterns.
